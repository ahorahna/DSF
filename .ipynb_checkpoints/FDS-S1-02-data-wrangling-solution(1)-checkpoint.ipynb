    "Because we specified `how='any'`, pandas drops a row if *any* column has a NaN value, so  the DataFrame is reduced to 1649 rows from 2938 rows initially. However, we wanted to discuss more ways of handling NaN values, and now we have dropped them. The good news is that  `dropna()` creates a copy, as usual with pandas DataFrame methods, and the original DataFrame is preserved. If you do want to apply those changes, you can use either `df = df.dropna(axis = 0, how = 'any')` or `df.dropna(axis = 0, how = 'any', inplace = True)`. `inplace=True` can be used in many DataFrame methods to apply the operations to the DataFrame.\n",

    "Now that we know that we didn't apply the changes to the DataFrame, let's discuss some more options for dealing with NaNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of `how = 'any'`, you can choose `'all'`, which drops rows only if *all* values are NaN. You can specify `axis=1`, to look along columns for NaN values and drop columns instead of rows. You can further set `subset=[col1, col2]` to search specific columns or rows for NaN values, and finally you can set a `thresh=N` to specify that at least `N` values need to be **non-NaN** to be kept. Give it a try!\n",

Using *inner* join means that you only want the intersection, while *outer* join means you want to keep the union. Sounds a bit abstract? Let's try it out."

    "- The three countries are Central African Republic, Angola, and Sierra Leone\n",
    "- It seems like the immunization against Hepatitis B is quite low (47%) in the Central African Republic, the *Mean* BMI of each country is within the norm (compared to most rich countries, which are generally overweight), which suggests that many people in those three countries are underweight. This is also shown in the thinness column showing that 8% of children are underweight. In the Central African Republic and in Angola, the immunization against Polio is very low, as well as against Diphtheria. "
