The 'whiskers', the lines extending from the box, can represent different things, as described on the [Wikipedia article on boxplots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot). By default, Matplotlib defines the end of the upper whisker as the value of the largest data point that lies within 1.5 times the interquartile range from the upper quartile, and the lower whisker as the value of the smallest data point that lies within 1.5 times the interquartile range from the lower quartile. Data points that lie outwith the whiskers are called outliers, and are represented by dots or circles.

    "### Remarks regarding Matplotlib vs Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you use Matplotlib or Seaborn in the course work is entirely up to you. The importance of Matplotlib lies in the fact that most researchers use Matplotlib and Seaborn is built on top of it. Now you have the tools at your hand to use Matplotlib, you know what to search for in the documentation and on stackoverflow when you are stuck with a plotting problem, you can easily understand the answers people post on stackoverflow. On the other hand, understanding the inner-workings of Matplotlib will help you to also easily understand the Seaborn documentation. It is up to you to spend some extra time playing around with Seaborn. The next exercise is optional, but we highly recommend that you do it.\n",
